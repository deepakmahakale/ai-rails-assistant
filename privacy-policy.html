      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how AI Rails Assistant collects, uses, and protects your data, specifically
        focusing on the handling of code snippets for error resolution in Rails applications.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Usage</h2>
      <p>The AI Rails Assistant extension is designed to assist you in debugging Rails applications by providing
        contextual solutions to detected errors. To achieve this, the extension:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collects only the relevant code snippet that caused the error in your Rails application.</li>
        <li>Uses this code snippet to provide context to the OpenAI ChatGPT service, enabling it to generate
          accurate and relevant solutions.</li>
        <li>Does not store these code snippets permanently. They are only temporarily used to generate a
          solution
          for the current error.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Security and Privacy</h2>
      <p>We prioritize the security and privacy of your data. The code snippets are transmitted securely to
        OpenAI's
        servers and are not shared with any other third parties.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Consent</h2>
      <p>By using the AI Rails Assistant extension, you consent to the collection and use of your code snippets as
        described in this policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please refrain from using the extension.
